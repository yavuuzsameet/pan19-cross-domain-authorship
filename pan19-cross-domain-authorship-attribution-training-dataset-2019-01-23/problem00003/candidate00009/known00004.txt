We can stop talking about this at any time, Tony,” Steve told him, patting his shoulder.

“How come you never said?” Tony asked plaintively.

“I did,” Steve admonished. “I told you this many times.”

“When?” Tony demanded.

Steve sighed. “Well, I don’t know, you didn’t like it when I said ‘gay’, so I tried a whole bunch of other ones.”

“Which other ones?” Tony shook his head. “I don’t remember this at all. I think this never happened.”

Steve started ticking off on his fingers, “confirmed bachelor,


“Don’t you want to settle down with a nice girl, have babies, that sort of thing?” Tony asked, “I mean, isn’t that the whole ’40’s dream or whatever?”



“I’m a confirmed bachelor, Tony,” Steve said, with an exasperated sigh.



“Yeah, Steve, I don’t think that means what you think it means anymore,” Tony said.



“It means,” Steve said, drawing it out, “that I am confirmed. As a bachelor. I will always be a bachelor, Tony. I am never going to marry a woman.”



Tony nodded. “Steve, you should maybe be careful about phrasing it that way.”


“enjoy the company of other men,


“Well, I really more enjoy the company of other men,” Steve added.



“Oh, I know,” Tony said, “I mean, yeah, it can be a lot easier to just pal around with the guys, I mean, especially for you, women weren’t really around much, yeah?”



Steve frowned in confusion.



“Well, you can be friends with, uh, dames, ‘dames’, right? You can be friends with them, now,” Tony said, “and you’re never going to get a date if you don’t.”


“queer,


“I’m queer, Tony, that’s what I mean,” Steve clarified.



Tony snorted into his fist.



“What?” Steve snapped.



“Oh, well, I mean, you’re not that weird, though,” Tony said, “well, I mean a little bit. But you’re Captain America! Ladies are going to like you no matter how strange you act.”



“I didn’t mean that I was odd, Tony,” Steve said.



“Also,” Tony whispered, “you maybe don’t want to use that word that way.”


“bent,


“Because I’m bent, Tony!” Steve said.



“Bent?” Tony asked.



Steve nodded vigorously. “Yes. You’ve got it now?”



“Is that, is that some sort of…slang?” Tony said.



Steve sighed. “Yes, Tony. Yes. It’s some sort of slang.”



“I don’t,” Tony said, “I don’t get your slang, I don’t think. I don’t know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, you know, not in this context. This context? Doesn’t scan.”



“It’s, it’s a word, Tony,” Steve stammered, “it means the same as queer. Well. I think it’s a little more insulting. But, basically the same.”



“Oh. Oooooh,” Tony said, “this is because I told you not to use ‘queer’.”


“man’s man,


“I,” Steve said, enunciating every syllable, “am a man’s man.”



“Sure, no one manlier,” Tony agreed. “Captain America, man’s man of all man’s…men? Men’s men? Men’s man? No, that one’s definitely not right.”



Steve snorted and covered a laugh with a cough.



“We’re getting off topic, Steve,” Tony said.


“queen,


“A queen, Tony,


“fairy,


“a fairy,


“friend of Dorothy,” Steve said.


“a friend of Dorothy,” Steve said.


“Oh, I kind of assumed the last one meant you just really liked Wizard of Oz,” Tony said. “You know, on account of it being the only movie that happened before you got frozen.”

“What?” Steve said, “there were a lot of movies back then, Tony.”

“Are you sure?” Tony asked, “I mean I can’t think of any.”

“You have literally talked to me about Metropolis in depth more than half a dozen times!” Steve said. “You called it your favorite movie!”


“And I mean,” Tony said, “people rely far too much on special effects, I think, CGI, you know, and you don’t need it to make a really great movie.”



“Oh, no, I totally agree,” Steve said. “I love that movie.”



“Oh, has JARVIS showed it to you?” Tony asked.



“At least three times
