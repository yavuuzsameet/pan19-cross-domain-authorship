- Derek was still there.

 

/When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale/

Derek had once looked up to Peter- he'd once dreamed of being like him someday. But now Peter was so different. Derek felt lost, like a little child that didn't know how to behave. He felt like a failure.

 

/I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide/

"Just tell him you love him," Isaac said. 

"I can't," Derek said softly. "I'm a werewolf, Isaac, he'll get hurt."

"He will already," Isaac answered. "And he knows that. He's not running into this blindly."

 

/No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come/

"You'd do anything to get your family back, wouldn't you Derek? Well so would I!" Gerard yelled at him. "You took Kate away and I want her back!"

"Life doesn't give us everything we want!" Stiles yelled back, leaping to defend Derek. "She took everything from him, and you want her back again?"

"I don't care about his family! I want all of mine!"

"Well they're dead!" Derek roared. "They're all dead!"

 

/When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide/

Stiles laid a hand on Derek's shoulder and looked up, meeting his eyes. 

"Why do you always blame yourself?" he asked softly.

Derek turned away from his touch though he didn't want to. "Because it's always my fault."

 

/When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl/

"Stiles! Hang on, we're almost there!"

"Derek...it's- it's alright."

"It's not, it's really not, Stiles! Please...just don't leave me."

 

/So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you've made/

"Let me in, Derek," Stiles said gently. "Please, let someone help you."

"I ruin everything, Stiles. Don't let me leave you a wreck."

"Derek, you're not lett-"

"Get out!" It pained him, but he needed to do it. "Leave, Stiles. Leave before you get hurt. You almost died once, and it could happen again."

 

/Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth/

"Derek, don't shut me out. You can't live like this. I know you want me safe, but I also know that it won't work because I'm a trouble magnet and- fuck, Derek, just...please." Stiles sighed. "It's not making anything better." 

Derek kept the voicemail but didn't answer.

 

/No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come/

He couldn't tell Stiles, couldn't let him back in. You can't be greedy with love- it only hurts people. 

But why did it feel like he hurt no matter what?

 

/When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide/

"Stiles, I'm a wreck." 

Stiles knew he was telling the truth when he looked at him, face distraught. "I don't care," he said. "Aren't we all anyway?"

 

/They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go/

Fate hated him. It really did. Every time he was happy he had to let it go, had to try and save what he could. And so he had to push Stiles away. 

 

/Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how/

He was still happy, still young, and Derek couldn't take that away. There was still innocence in his eyes and he couldn't bear to see that go.

 

/When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where
