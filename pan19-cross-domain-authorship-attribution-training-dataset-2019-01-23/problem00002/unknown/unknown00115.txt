They train their men to be fighters and their women to be leaders.

You are born to be a leader.

---

You’re five years old, and your father presses a bow in your hand, and you’re not sure why, but you learn to aim, and you learn to hit your mark.

You learn to win, and when the arrow hits its target, you feel free.

---

You move a lot. Your parents say it’s for work, and you don’t question them, even when you have to go through seventh grade twice.

You get used to it. It’s sort of exciting to see new places, and you try not to think too much about the mysterious deaths that seem to plague every new town.

---

Beacon Hills becomes home more quickly than the rest.

You meet Lydia who borrows your clothes and invites you to parties and decorates your locker for the birthday, even when you don’t want her to.

You meet Scott, and even though you weren’t planning on dating until college, you fall for him harder than you ever expected.

One by one, the pieces fall into place.

---

Kate tells you the truth, and you don’t understand at first, but it all makes sense soon enough. You were meant to be a hunter. It only seems natural.

You watch Peter Hale kill Kate, and you have to lash out. Your aim is true, and as you watch him burn, you don’t feel bad.

You try not to cry at Kate’s funeral. You know she was wrong, and you still hate her for trying to kill Scott, but you can’t help it. In spite of everything, she was still like a sister to you.

---

Your family starts to train you in earnest, and you still don’t understand everything, but you’re glad for it. You want to protect yourself.

---

Your mother dies, and you feel nothing but rage and grief.

You hear Derek Hale was responsible, and all you want is revenge.

---

You and Scott break up and get back together and break up again. You love him, and sometimes he feels like the most important thing in the world, but sometimes, you think he doesn’t matter at all.

You were never there to be the hero’s girlfriend. You’re there to be the hero.

---

That summer, Lydia asks you why you kept her in the dark. You tell her you thought it would protect her.

“You don’t help people by being cryptic,” she says. “You help people by being there.”

---

Erica dies, and Boyd dies, and you feel a twinge of regret, remembering when you almost became their killer.

You never knew them well enough to mourn them fully, not really. Still, you can’t help but wonder how you live in a world where dead teenagers are just a part of life.

---

You understand now what you’re supposed to do. You understand now why your family’s code is wrong.

You’re not there to kill anyone. You’re there to protect them.

---

You start to have visions of Kate, and it terrifies you. You’re terrified of her, and you’re terrified you could become her.

You’re not sure which part would be worse: being evil or being dead.

---

You never tell anyone just how scared you are of becoming an orphan. You’ve lost too many people already. If you lost your father, you’re not sure you could handle it.

You tell him you love him just in case.

---

You protect Lydia, and you protect Isaac. You end up with a sword through your stomach, and somehow, you think you were destined to end like this.

You let Scott hold you and tell him you love him, because after everything, you still mostly do. For a minute, you wish that you were just the damsel in distress and that the hero could swoop in and save you, but that has never been your story.

---

They tell you that you were born to be a leader. They never tell you that you were born to die.
