but it isn't now and it isn't up to you or anything you or anybody says." His voice is getting louder with each word. She knocks everything off the table taking her purse and scarf and taking his jacket too. turning to him slamming with his jacket. "Are you degraded enough to go to the bank with your mother." And she walks out.

"In cases like this I have to ask is everything ok?" The banker asks."Nothing is okay. When someone needs that amount of money in cash. But it's my money and It's not of your goddamn business." The banker looks from Zayn to Tricia, "Are you a relation?" She asks. "this is my son" Tricia answers her. "Either you can't see uncanny resemblance or implying she is under duress or something?" Zayn says."Should I be?" The banker asks with a tight smile she can't be fucked with."Dear, it's my money.. And there is plenty of it and don't even start tell me all this bullshit is for my protection because that is understood. You have the withdrawal slip, here this is my ID" she hands it to her "there are sufficient funds my family has been with this bank since my father in law started it. Now what I want is two hundred and sixty thousand  dollars in cash." Tricia ends teeth gritted."Are you sure you want that in cash" the banker asks."In cash.. Ok? Cash" Tricia says trying to control her rage."I'm sorry I gotta ask.." The banker starts . Tricia cuts her off "What?!!" "For a second. Identification. It's for your own protection"Zayn is sitting there hiding behind his sunglasses which covers his dignity.

"This is the last of it. If I ever have to hear about your problems again, I will never see you again do you understand that?" Tricia tells him that in a pained voice holding the money, Zayn looks everywhere but her but he nods.She drops the envelop of money hard on the floor and grabs him by his jacket crying "I NEED YOU TO FUCKING UNDERSTAND THAT"  she looks at people around them in the street  "am I embarrassing you? Do you want to just take the money" Zayn shakes his head not looking at her. "You want to just take the money and go. Even if I say goodbye to you and consider it cheap to be rid of you" leaving her hold on his jacket roughly. "Yeah, I wanna take the money and go" he says still not meeting her eyes. She looks at him shocked eyes filling with more tears. She backs away couple of steps then turns around. Tears falling and a choked sob leaving her throat.Zayn leans down taking the envelop. She looks back at him he catches her eyes.She recovers herself drying her tears which did nothing and heads to her car head held high.

Zayn is sitting on a bench, and he sees him, walking out of the building headphones on and he's so into what he's listening to, and he keeps watching him as he says Hi to some of the people he knows, lips moving with the lyrics as he walks to his car head bobbing to the tune. he passes by him but Doesn't notice Zayn.Liam gets in his car and he catches Zayn in his rearview, he drives backwards and rolls the window "Hey!" "Hey" And they stay locking eyes for what seems like forever till Liam speaks leaning as he talks "if I have to pull you into an inappropriate relationship to get you out of your job, I'm ready to go" Liam says smiling with a shy smirk and Zayn doesn't know how is that possible.

They are sitting on a blanket in this huge desert, wind blowing around them. Zayn crossed legged. Liam leaning on his palms."What if I told you that I'm not a gambler?" Zayn says looking at LiamLiam meets his stare and Zayn continues "What if you saw me with a needle in my arm? And I told you that I'm not a Junkie?" Liam's lips tilts with a smile "I saw you be a professor and I know you are not one of those" he says raising an eyebrow. Zayn laughs at that and turns to look forward. Sighs "it's good to come out here.. It's good"."I come out here because it makes me feel alive" Liam tells him, "No. No" Zayn says shaking his head turning to look at him and Liam is not meeting his eyes looking on his left. "No, not good enough. There is something else I don't quite know what it is, I
