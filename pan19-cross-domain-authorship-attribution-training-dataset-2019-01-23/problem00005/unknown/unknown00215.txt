If I'd just drank too much and imagined the whole thing, or if it had actually happened and she had brought me home. Or if I had just gone plain mad. Jesus christ. There was my phone under my pillow I felt it as I propped myself onto the bed. Exhausted both mentally and physically I checked my phone reading:
