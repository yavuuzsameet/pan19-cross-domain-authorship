said.

"Yeah, sure! No problem." Zayn agreed.

"Hey guys, it's raining." Liam said worriedly.

"Haven't brought my umbrella." Harry sighed.

"Me too." Liam said.

"You guys can crash on the sofa." Niall offered.

"Thanks, mate." Harry and Liam said in unison.

"How 'bout you, Zayn?" Niall asked.

"Nah, I'm going back home. I've got an umbrella." Zayn declined.

"Okay. See you in the morning?" Liam asked.

"Sure. Bye, guys!" Zayn then left.

When he returned home, he collapsed on the bed, but he couldn't sleep, although he was tired. He tossed and turned, thinking about Louis.

When he finally could fall asleep, he was woken up by his phone ringing.

"Vas happening?" Zayn groaned.

"Zayn?" The voice on the other side was quiet and shaky, but it was, unexpectedly…

"Louis?"

"Zayn, god, I'm so sorry, I don't know, please, come get me, I'm-"

"Lou, Louis, calm down. Where are you?" Zayn asked frantically, now wide awake.

"I'm so, so sorry, I, I didn't mean to wake you up, I don't know what to do, I'm at a club, the, the Aristotle Club, god, please, Zayn-" 

"Lou, I'm coming, okay? Just stay where you are."

"Zayn-" Suddenly, the call disconnected.

"Lou?" Cursing under his breath, he called Louis again, but the call went straight to voicemail.

Zayn ran downstairs, hurriedly calling a taxi and arriving at the Aristotle Club in less than five minutes. Turned out that the club was just a block away from his home.

"Zayn?"

"Louis!"

Even in the dim light, Zayn could still see Louis in the alley, utterly soaked in water.

"God, I'm so sorry, Zayn, I could only remember your number, and-"

"No, don't apologize, Louis. C'mon, you must be cold. I'll get you to my home first, to warm you up, 'kay?" Zayn said gently.

 Zayn walked towards Louis, wrapping an arm around his waist and guiding him slowly out of the alley.

As the light from the street lights shone on Louis, Zayn couldn't help but suck in a breath.

Hey guys, sorry for really overdue updates! Was busy with school stuff... so enjoy this chapter, and sorry for cliffhangers again!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Even in the dim light, Zayn could clearly see every bruise and every cut on Lou’s face.

 

“God, Lou, what happened?” Zayn asked gently, even though he desperately wanted to murder every person who had did this to their Louis. "Lou?”

 

Heartbeat quickening, he saw that Louis was slumped against him, but he wasn’t unconscious yet.

 

Letting out a breath he hadn’t even realized he was holding, Zayn shifted a bit and started walking towards his home. Along the way, he tried to talk with Louis, but the Doncaster boy was either too tired or he didn’t want to sleep. One way or another, Zayn finally got home.

 

Louis stumbled a bit when he released him. Rummaging in a shelf, he suddenly had a horrifying thought.

 

He wasn’t tired. That was something very strange. When he was carrying someone and walking a block, he should be very tired. But now instead, he wasn’t. So either he was very strong, or Louis was very, very light.

 

Heart sinking, he turned to face Louis with a first-aid kit in hand. “Lou, I’ve got to clean up the cuts first, ‘kay?”

 

Louis just slowly pulled off his T-shirt and let him see.

 

“Christ!” Zayn didn’t mean to, but he couldn’t help it. Because Louis’s stomach was a patchwork of black and red mixed together, and some of his cuts were still bleeding, and it didn’t help that Louis had started crying, his whole body trembling.

 

“Oh Lou, please don’t cry.” Zayn carefully hugged the boy, avoiding his wounds as Louis cried his heart out.

 

After a while, Louis’s sobs subsidized, and Zayn grinned. “Now that’s better. C’mon, I’ve still got to take care of those wounds.”

 

Zayn looked at Louis and sighed internally. He was so thin, all his ribs and bones showing. After bandaging every single wound, he led Louis to his bed and both of them slept, not caring about the future.

The next day, Zayn woke up by the doorbell ringing.

 

Looking to the side, he saw Louis sitting upright, body tense and eyes filled with fear.

 

“Lou, it
