glance before his gaze met with the boy in front him. The boy’s blue eyes blazed as he glared up at Dean and, if possible, he seemed to get broader under his jacket as he stated, his voice gravel rough, “I believe you parked in the wrong space. Please move your car.”

Dean gave him a cocky grin, knowing better than to take his eyes off his opponent, and said, “I didn’t see anyone’s name on it.”

With that, Dean pushed past the boy to merge with the crowd pouring towards the entrance, feeling the boy’s eyes on his back until the doors swung closed behind him.

The next morning, Dean headed for his parking spot, slamming on the brakes when he saw the pale blue pickup truck already in his baby’s place. On the asphalt in front of it, scrawled in bright green paint, was ELIOT’S SPACE, the empty Howard’s Hardware bag lying crumpled by the tire indicating its recent purchase. Eliot was leaning against the fender, the can still in his hand, the yellow price tag declaring SALE $1.00. As Dean paused to glare at the vehicle taking his baby’s spot, a small smile tugged at Eliot’s mouth as he growled, “Got a name on it now, don’t it cowboy?”

Dean just gritted his teeth and planned a retaliatory shopping spree.

Eliot was already halfway across the parking lot when the final school bell rang, streams of students spilling out of every possible exit in a relentless wave. He hummed a little under his breath, smiling just a little when he saw his baby parked in her space, welcoming him with a sparkle off her windshield.

But when he got to the driver’s side door, his smile disappeared, melting into that all-too-familiar scowl. His steering wheel was now adorned with something new, The Club crossing its diameter a bright, neon yellow. On the seat was a happy face key ring, with what looked like over a hundred keys attached to the large metal hoop. Eliot paused, turning slowly to scan the parking lot in time to see Dean drive by and give him a cheerful wave as he pulled out into the street. With an angry huff, Eliot snatched the keys off the seat through the open window, the obnoxious smiling face twisting in his hand to reveal it’s optimistic message on the other side.

HAVE A NICE DAY! 

                                                                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each day progressed with more wildly random purchases designed to drive each other crazy. There was the time Dean came out to find his car proudly bearing a semaphore message along its antennae. The fact that he was the only one in the parking lot, aside from a few Eagle Scouts, that could decode the rather rude sentiment meant very little. Then there was the day Dean filled the back of Eliot’s truck with little plastic balls in primary colors, like the ball pits at Chuck E. Cheese. Eliot retaliated by attaching a strip of neon pink tassels around Dean’s windshield, which caused a vein that Dean hadn’t known he had to throb mercilessly in his temple.

When his father finally raised an eyebrow at the strings of Mardi Gras beads and feather boas Dean came home with one afternoon, all Dean mumbled was “School project”, which seemed to settle the matter. Dean began to wonder if this Eliot kid was independently wealthy, because this revenge thing was an expensive business, and he’d had to double time on the pool hustling to supplement his meager allowance for all of these shopping sprees.

Events evolved to far more intricate levels of one-upmanship within the month. Dean adjusted Eliot’s truck horn to belt out “La Cucaracha”. Eliot’s response was more subtle; when Dean unlocked the Impala, a car alarm blared across the school parking lot for twenty minutes until Dean could find where Eliot had hidden the control box.

By this point everyone in school, except for the administration, knew about the Parking Space War, though even the teachers had begun to wonder what all the ruckus was after school every day.

The final straw came on a Wednesday.

Nothing heralded the moment. It was a beautiful, balmy spring day, the sky a brilliant cloudless blue. The students swarmed out of the building, their laughter bright and happy as a few hours of freedom beckoned.

A panicked voice shattered the idyllic scene. “Where’s my car?!”

Most immediately thought the high-pitched shriek belonged to a girl, but the wave of students that swept back revealed only an ashen faced Dean Winchester staring at the space where he had left his vehicle that morning, Eliot’s large, blue truck now taking up the spot.

A murmur of voices spilled out behind him, some latecomers laughing about a car parked in the middle of the football field out back, and Dean’s eyes zeroed in on Eliot leaning so smugly against the grille of his truck.

“You. Touched. My. Car.”

Eliot shrugged dismissively.

“You. Drove. My. Baby.”

Eliot looked unconcerned.

“You’
