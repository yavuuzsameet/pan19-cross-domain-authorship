don't really sound like you."

"Of course I am. Listen, I gotta go Dean. I'll call you soon."

You hung up and Dean was left with the dial tone.

Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause you don't sound like you anymore


"Hey Sam?"

Sam looked up from the research he was doing, "Ya?"

"Have you talked to Y/N recently?"

Sam nodded, "Ya, and?"

Dean took a seat, "Does she seem... Different?"

Sam put the book he was reading down, "Different how?"

"Well for one, where's her drawl? You know, the country drawl that's she's had since... Like forever?"

"I don't know man, people change."

Dean shook his head, "you can't just loose a drawl that you've had all your life. She got it from her dad."

Sam shrugged, "I don't know man, if she's happy then it doesn't matter."

Dean nodded his head absently.

Your pretty brown hair, you always loved it
Guess he didn't like it so you just cut it
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like


Sam got a phone call a couple months later, "Hey Dean! Y/N's calling!"

Sam put it on speaker, "Hey baby girl."

"Hey Dean. Hey Sam."

"What's up Y/N?"

"So I cut my hair."

The brothers eyebrows furrowed.

"You cut your hair? How short?"

"To my shoulders... Looks good though."

Sam chuckled, "I bet it does. Why'd you cut it?"

"Oh you know... Wanted a change. I've had my hair long for so long, why not try something different?"

Dean's frown deepened, "Ya..."

"I just wanted to let you guys know. Miss you guys."

"We miss you too baby girl."

"Ya... I'll talk to you guys later, I need to help Matt."

'Cause baby you don't sound like you anymore
Oh, anymore


Dean smacked Sam's arm, "Cut her hair? Now does that sound like the Y/N we know? She hates short hair."

Sam shrugged, "you heard her, she wanted a change."

Dean shook his head.

That town, that job, that guy
You can leave them behind, girl, you know you're better than that
If you want to come back, you can come back
Baby, come back to


"De?"

"Hey baby girl. What's wrong?"

"I-I miss you guys, so much. I-I want to come home."

Dean straightened, "You know you can always come home."

Dean heard a sniffle, "You crying baby girl?"

"N-No..."

"Oh Y/n, what did he do to you?"

"W-Would you come and get me? I want to come home."

Dean was already up and heading to your truck that you had left, claiming you didn't need it.

"Ya baby girl, I'm coming, I'm bringing Hunter."

You gave a watery laugh.

'Cause you don't sound like you
Give me the girl I knew,
'Cause you don't sound like you anymore
Mm, anymore


You knew when Dean pulled up, you heard your baby.

You ran outside and saw Dean getting out of Hunter. You ran to him and jumped at him.

"Hey little girl."

"I've missed you so much."

"Me too. We've missed you, it hasn't been the same without you."

Dean helped you get your things and you were in the truck now, driving.

Dean let you drive because you hadn't since you left, that was about eight months ago.

"So, wanna tell me what's been going on?"

"What do you mean?"

"Well you're not you. You cut your hair, your country drawl is gone, What happened?"

"It's nothing."

Dean nodded, "Alright... Then why'd you decide to come back?"

"I just- I missed you and Sam."

Dean stared at you, your hands were tightened on the wheel, "Come on Y/N. Tell the truth."

You glanced at him, "That is."

Dean shook his head, "man, what did he do to you?"

"He didn'
