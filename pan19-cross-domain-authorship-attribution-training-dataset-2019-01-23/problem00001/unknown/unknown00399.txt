taking chances that had a high probability of success behind them.

Dean was a cobra, striking fast and deep – Sam was a boa, patiently constricting until there was no way out.As Sam released his breath he fell quickly to his knees, a sharp *zing* *zing* whistling by his ear and splattering into a colored explosion of yellow paint against the bark of the tree where he’d just been leaning. Sam crawled over to a barrier of brush, his eyes tracing the path of the paintball pellets to see his brother’s back fading into the trees.

Damn. Dean was trying to end this quickly, force him out of hiding while he was still adjusting to the game.

Dean forgot whom he was dealing with.

Sam was exactly where Dean knew he’d be, hugging a tree and going all zen in the wilderness. Dean snorted. Sammy was so predictable.

Sam had grown, but he was clumsy. Farther reach, but uncoordinated, no muscle to balance it out. His growth spurt made his aim shaky as he tried to learn how to adjust his sights.

Sam didn’t take risks - would spend all day strategizing rather than getting down to it. Dean didn’t see the point in waiting if you had a good chance of winning. Waiting gave your opponent time to come up with a plan of attack.

Sam was smart – couldn’t risk giving him that time to plan. Take him out fast, when he was still unsettled and trying to figure things out.

This was hunting and hunting was action. Sure, planning was useful, but the opportunity didn’t come up very often. You had to think fast, think on your feet, learn to adapt to rapidly changing situations, or you could die.That was something Sam never seemed to understand.

Sometimes, Dean hoped he never would.

Sam rolled his feet as he walked, a trick his father had taught them, careful not to carelessly crush the leaves and twigs that would give his position away. Movement was a calculated risk in a situation like this – motion drew the eye, the subtle noise of branches sliding around something that didn’t belong catching the ear. It was safest to time advances through the brush as the wind blew, but it obscured the hearing, allowing someone to sneak up if ears weren’t kept open and ready.

Sam squatted low behind a fallen tree, closing his eyes for a second to remember what Dean had been wearing, what he’d done to get ready that morning.

Was he wearing those clunky boots he loved so much? The ones with the buckles that made that soft *tink* *tink* *tink* noise when he walked? Had he put on that watch Dad had got him? The one that had the wide face that reflected the light of the sun when he hung his arm out the window of the Impala as he drove? Had he filled the car before he drove out here, leaving him with the subtle scent of gasoline seeping from his pores?Without even thinking about it, Sam sniffed delicately, scenting for his brother who always smelled of cheap soap, gasoline and, all too often, Cheetoes. When he opened his eyes, he caught a sudden flash of light off to his left and turned, firing several rounds at the spot. *zing* *zing* *zing* Sam slunk over, hiding behind a ridge of rock until he could see if he’d gotten a killing shot.

Dean’s watch hung off a broken tree branch, twinkling teasingly in the scattered rays of sunlight trickling through the leaves, bright spots of day-glo orange paint speckling its face.

Fuck. It was a trap.Sam ducked as a paint pellet *zing*ed by his ear, spatters of yellow flecking his cheek as the pellet burst against the rock by his head. As Sam rolled, he shot blindly in the direction the pellets had come, hoping to distract Dean as he tried to regain his footing.

Once on his feet, Sam darted down the hill, twining recklessly through the trees as Dean crashed after him, the sound of pellets whizzing by his head a musical accompaniment to Sam’s panting breaths as splashes of yellow appeared randomly around him. He felt a sharp sting in his shoulder, but kept running, leaping over a fallen trunk disguised by the brush.

Sam ducked to the right, rolling around the back of a tree and stilling as the sound of Dean’s pursuit suddenly paused, his big brother hidden from sight by the angle of the hill. Sam heard a hesitant rustle as Dean considered following him down the incline, but then the soft shuffling melted back into the trees. Dean had lost him.

Sam reached over his shoulder, rubbing vainly at the sting. His fingers came away swathed in yellow. He’d gotten hit. If this were real, his shooting arm would be useless.

Fuck. He’d gotten sloppy. It had been too long.                                                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Damn, that kid could run like a deer.Dean rubbed the back of his hand over his forehead,
