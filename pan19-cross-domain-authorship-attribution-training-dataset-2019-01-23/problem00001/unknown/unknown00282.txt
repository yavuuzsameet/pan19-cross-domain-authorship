Chapter banners! The idea of them are near and dear to my heart!  And Cassie and Dani did such a great job naming each chapter and finding a quote to support their message
that they just screamed -- make me art!

So, I did.  What I attempted to do with each of these chapters is pull out some key element that would further entice the reader but not give away the chapter.

And... here they are!

 











































These are cards, the Residence Cards, depict the homes of the main players of our story, including Dean, Sam and Bobby, Cas, Gabriel and others.There are also Location Cards for all the key locations where our story takes place.

These were nearly a last minute addition.  Dani and Cassie spent a good deal of time
choosing the type of home that their characters would inhabit.  And they had links to
actual properties, but, unfortunately, some of those lovely places were sold already.

I found comparable sites and then thought it might be neat to do a little banner showing
where our guys all hung their hats and laid their heads!

And... here they are!
These are the original images created for the final posting of the story during the DCBB challenge!
Take a peek in the next chapter at the ones re-created for the second posting!





MASSACHUSETTES & VERMONT

With the Residence Banners done, they looked so cool... and I'd collected all these
images while shopping around for the images I'd ultimately used, that I thought... hey,
why not do a few other mini-banners for the other locations.  So, I did!

OTHER LOCATIONS









So, Cassie and Dani decided to repost their DCBB for 2016!

And this time around, since we had a little more time to do these particular images, I offered to reconfigure them.  These Residence and Location Cards are really tags that separate the various locations detailed in the story.  This time around I redesigned them to allow for the text that accompanies the image to be nested with the card in just text so that readers who do not recieve images would not lose that tag.  It's a bit hard to explain. You'll see what I mean with this posting.  I've put the 'card' images up with the accompanying text as they appear in the story.

CHAPTER FOUR: THE DOCK



When I first signed on, as is my habit, I asked Dani and Cassie if there was anything specific that they'd like to see depicted.  Both of them chimed in that there was a scene that takes place on the dock of the Krushnic family
home in upstate New York.

This was a very difficult manipulation to accomplish.  I can't even tell you how many different layers are in here.  I can tell you that it took about 12 hours to accomplish!  I may do a walk through on this one.

But for starters, first I needed to beat up
