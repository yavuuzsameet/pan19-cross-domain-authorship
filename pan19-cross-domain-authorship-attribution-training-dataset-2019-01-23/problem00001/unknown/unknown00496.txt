thing was, he may have been an angel sent from heaven, but he had all the natural grace of a drunken water buffalo when it came to anything requiring manual dexterity. It was the loss of cell phone number six that sent Dean over the edge.

“How in the hell do you keep breaking these things?!” Dean half-shouted in annoyance. He did not deign to acknowledge the amazed squeak that had cracked that last syllable.

“My human fingers are too large for such tiny keys. I wish the one where you touch the screen.”

“Don’t we all,” Dean said with a disgruntled sigh. “Just take this one. It’s the hardest to break.”

“I want the one with the screen.”

“I said no.”

Sam sighed, gripping the bridge of his nose between his eyes as he felt another headache coming on. “Just give it to him, Dean.”

“You’re spoiling him!” The half-shout was a forgotten memory as Dean’s voice carried through the store, drawing the attention of everyone within hearing. “How is he ever going to learn to take care of his stuff if you give him everything he asks for?!”

A passing mother gave Dean a look of commiseration, shrugging her shoulders as she glanced from him to Sam in a what-can-you-do? gesture.

“You’re not paying for it,” Sam reminded him in a whisper. “Just get it for him so we can go home.”

“Fine,” Dean hissed grumpily, handing the credit card over to the amused cashier. “But this is the last one!” he warned Castiel over his shoulder.

Castile just hmphed non-committally, already tweeting about the latest report that Lucifer might be headed for Kansas City.

The sight of Castiel frowning at his favorite toy caused Sam to pause his unpacking, and he casually leaned against the doorjamb.

“What’s up?” Sam paused, his mouth falling in as the possibilities struck him. “Oh, God…please don’t tell me you broke that one, too. Dean just had a snit over the bill, and we don’t even pay it!”

“I posted a picture of our triumph over the demon legion at Sunizona and….” Castiel frowned again, the smooth skin of his forehead wrinkling into a series of perfectly aligned valleys.

“And what?”

“I am not sure the humans understand the importance of what we are doing.”

“Why?” Dean asked as he dropped his duffel on the bed nearest the door, catching the tail end of the conversation.

“They said we were hot.”

“Some of us are,” Dean agreed absently, sniffing one of his T-shirts to see if it needed washing before tossing it at Sam’s head. “I’m not ashamed.”

Sam slipped the phone out of Castiel’s hands, glancing at the Twitter screen. “Holy crap! You’re a Trendy Twit!” Sam looked at him with something like awe. “Do you even know what that means?”

Castiel sighed, his lower lip sticking out slightly. “That we have lost the element of surprise. I hope Lucifer’s minions are not amongst my followers. I would hate to give away our location.”

“What’s a what?” Dean grumbled, snatching the phone from Sam and looking at the screen. “Good goin’ on the stealth thing, Cas. It’s not like the picture of me in front of the Welcome to Sacramento sign would give anything away. When did you have time to take that anyway?”

“You had just burned the demon corpses and were relieving yourself by the roadside.”

Sam snorted somewhere behind him, and Dean flipped him the finger.

“Then it’s no wonder you’re a Trendy Twat, or whatever. It's a damn good picture, if I do say so myself.”

“Your dick is not responsible for over 19,000 followers,” Sam said with a chuckle. “Get over yourself.”

“Just you watch. I’ll bet you breakfast that it’ll be over 20,000 by tomorrow morning.”

And damn it all to hell if Dean wasn’t right. Sam paid up the next morning with a noted lack of grace.

Dean just flirted with the waitress through his mouthful of blueberry pancakes and told her to check out his buddy angel_face on this thing called Twister. With a blue-tinged grin, he said if she saw anything she liked to give him a call.

Castiel’s love affair with Twitter seemed to reignite after the surge in interest from the infamous Salute to Schwarzenegger photo, as his followers came to call it. He informed their “army” of their every move, to the point where they were getting information about good diners and motels all over the country. Tips on Lucifer sightings even came down the line, though they inevitably turned out to be wildly exaggerated by Castiel’s fans – from some guy who had fallen asleep on the beach and turned a rather startling shade of red, to a drunk frat boy who said
