taking the last one. You were both so drunk you didn’t hesitate to lift your shirt up. Dean crawled over to you his hand going out to touch until you slapped him away. He laughed falling to the floor pulling you on top of him. That was the last thing you remember. 

 

“What the fuck guys!” Sam yelled jolting you awake. You groan holding your head until you felt a hand up your shirt. The hand squeezed for a moment before jerking away quickly. You glared at Dean who was next to you giving you and apologetic look holding his hands in the air.

“They have a mind of their own.” He said in defense getting up from the floor where Y'all had been cuddling. 

“Get up we are leaving in 20 minutes.” Sam said going back upstairs. Dean looked over to you with a small shy smile as he went to get cleaned up. You went up to your room changing into a tank top and jeans that hugged your hips. You met the brothers down the stair in the living room. 

“My head is killing me Sam will you drive please.” Dean groaned pulling on the cheap tie around his neck. Sam scowled at his brother taking the keys before storming out to the car. You and Dean exchanged a odd look following him to the Impala. You climbed in the back while Dean took shotgun his head falling to the back of the long bench seat. He rolled to the right turning his body. Not even 5 minutes after you start to Shoshoni you got a text from Dean.

Dean: Sorry about my hand on your breast this morning

You look at it unsure what to say you looked over at him still curled in the seat acting asleep.

You: I just wasn’t expecting a Winchester to make a move on me

You send it blushing slight turning to look out the window. Your phone vibrated again you looked up at Sam for a moment seeing if he noticed. His eyes flicked back down at the road from the rear-view mirror suggesting that he had noticed and was trying to hide it. You look at your phone trying not to smile.

Dean: Are you kidding? I’m lucky I even got to spend the night with you

You: Are you flirting with me? 

You bite your lip naturally feeling butterflies in your stomach as you stare at the screen.

“Who are you texting?” Sam asked irritably making you look up into his eyes glaring at you in the mirror. You change to your voice app typing your response. 

“I’m playing a game.” You lie scowling back at Sam. “It’s none of your business who I text.” You also add before laying down in the seat where he couldn’t see upi. Sam scoffed dropping the subject just driving faster.

Dean: You’re really making him mad 

You: Good

Dean didn’t message you back for a moment making you nervous.

You: You never answered my question…. 

No answer for a few minutes made you feel like a cheap whore just being used by both men. They took your emotions on a rollercoaster almost every conversation it seemed like.

Dean: Would you be mad if I said yes

Your heart thudded harder like last night when Sam pushed you up against the wall. You bite your lip naturally squeezing your legs together. 

You: I would say what took you so damn long

“We are here.” Sam said pulling you and Dean from the intense conversation. You sat up in the seat a light blush of pink on your cheeks making Sam scowl at you yet again. 

“I think it would be best if you waited in the car for now.” Sam said to you as Dean got out of the car quickly. You smirk at Sam putting your head in your hands, but nodding yes. Sam looked at you a moment longer before stepping out of the car. They walked in like the owned the place with their fake FBI badges and cheap suits. You half expected Dean to keep texting you, but your phone remained silent for 2 hours until the boys came back out to the car with a case file in Sam’s hand. Dean got in the passenger seat again not looking back at you. 

“I told you there was no case here yesterday.” Dean said angrily shutting the door while Sam climbed in the driver side handing you the case file. 

“I think you're wrong. _____ can you please look at it and tell me what you think.” Sam asked as he put the car into reverse speeding back to your house. Most of the deaths in the file seemed to have nothing to do with each other. No one knew anyone similar, all the deaths were months apart, there were all accidents or natural causes ranging in age from 2 years old up to 86. You type in your opinion into your app looking up to see Sam pulling into your driveway. 

“I don’t see a case.” Your app says giving Sam a shrug before climbing out of the car. Dean growled going to the front door. Sam took the file from you following you up to the house.
