a grimace. “If he shits on the floor, I’m chargin’ you triple.”

Sam looked down at his shoe, and pressed his lips together as he tried to calm down.

“Dean?”

No response.

“Dean! Get out here!”

The sheet ruffled under the bed, and Sam turned towards the noise.

“There’s no excuse for this! You’ve got opposable thumbs…use the damn toilet!” 

                                                                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Yeah…I know!” Sam laughed into the phone, rustling around in the grocery bags and pulling out an overly ripe banana. “That’s exactly what I told him!”

Sam tossed it towards his brother, who was bouncing on the bed and rolling back and forth across the rumpled sheets, making low, happy noises as he did so. The banana rebounded off the pillow and landed by Dean’s head, where he picked it up and tore into it with his teeth, before peeling away the skin in strips and dropping them to the floor.

“You’re picking that up,” Sam told him, keeping the phone awkwardly trapped against his shoulder with his cheek as he tried to sort out his purchases. Pulling out a large box of diapers, he pointed from the box to Dean and back again. Dean flipped Sam the finger as he stuck his tongue out, mashed up banana oozing from his mouth.

“Nice. You remember that and how to masturbate, but you can’t seem to remember how to use the bathroom. Good skill set you’ve got there, Cheetah.”

Sam snorted as he refocused on his previous conversation. “No, I’m not talking to you, Bobby. I’m sure you manage that just fine.”

He paused, cocking his head to the side to listen to whatever it was Bobby was saying, and he quickly interrupted. “She said – no, make that shouted and threw a flowerpot – that Dean was no better than an animal, and she’d make sure everyone could see it.” Sam’s brows arched upwards. “He did his usual Dean thing, as far as I know…my guess is she took him seriously.”

Sam groaned and rubbed at his eyes one-handed as Bobby spoke. “I want to keep going back there as a last resort. I really don’t want that girl pissed at me. What if she turns me into a giraffe or something?”

He hmphed into the phone, sticking a straw into a juice box and walking over to hand it to Dean, who clumsily puckered his lips and tried to slurp up the straw, before finally managing to get it in his mouth. “I guess we could try that, but I have no idea where to look. Maybe I can try the bar where he found her.”

Sam clicked the phone shut with a decided slump to his shoulders, before turning to Dean, who loped over and crooned softly at him as he stroked Sam’s hair. “Bobby says we should look up her coven. One of them should be able to take off the spell, or tell us how to break it.”

Dean hooted happily and clapped his hands together, before grabbing his feet in both hands and rolling backwards on the carpet.

“Get back here, Baby Hughie,” Sam said, grabbing for the diapers. “There’s no avoiding the inevitable.” 

                                                                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bar was just like their usual dive, and Sam was a bit surprised that this was the preferred hangout for the local coven. He had almost expected a tea shop with lace doilies, rather than a low end honky tonk with a bull ride machine in the back.

The bartender was less than enthused to answer his questions, but it may have been his discomfort with Dean’s proximity, rather than any hesitance to share what he knew.

“I’ll take a beer,” Sam said, and Dean screeched loudly and pounded the table. “Uh…one for my friend, too.” He noticed that the diaper he’d managed to somehow duct tape on Dean before leaving the hotel was already gone.

Bastard.

The bartender carefully shoved two bottles of beer in their direction, and Dean snatched his with a friendly waggle of his head, prying the lid off with his long canines and taking a long drink.

The man just inched further away from Dean. “You know they bite, right? There was that guy in California that got his nose clear torn off.”

Sam paused, remembering the story, and turned to give Dean a worried stare.

Dean just grinned, flashing fang, and carefully stuck his middle finger up his nose.

Sam sighed in relief. Yeah, Dean was still Dean.

“He’s…tame,” Sam explained, glaring at Dean out of the corner of his eye in a silent warning to behave. Dean just yanked the peanut bowl closer and starting stuffing his cheeks full of nuts, until they bulged outwards in the imitation of a chipmunk. “But he’s got no table manners.”

“Uh-huh,” the bartender agreed with obvious doubt. “So…you were asking about Patty
