"okay? Just like that, you're willing to give me anything I want from you just like that?"-if  he was curious about the omega first now it has his attention, never in all the centuries castile has lived and made deals no one has been this quick to accept any condition he proposed no one except dean.

"yeah, just like that, I got nothing waiting for me, that's why I'm here in the first place, so tell me cas, what do you want with me, may I ask?"-even thou his voice was calm, dean was scared shitless, because what if this demon wanted him as a pet or even worse, a breeder.

"well, dean, I've been looking for someone like you for quite some time now, you see, I'm in need of a mate and you have what I want as a mate"-cas said tilting his head and smirking

Dean froze hearing those words, cas wanted him as a mate, someone as dean who wasn't meek and submissive, who was built like an alpha, the demon wanted a male omega has his mate

"that's joke isn't, make fun of the abomination, you're joking aren't you?"- he snorted, it could only be a joke right? No one could possibly want dean like that could they?

" I assure you its not a joke, I've always been looking for a male omega, you see, they are the rarest gender there is, not a lot of them happen to live past their presentation, an where did you get that they're abominations?"-surely he had heard wrong, why would anyone call himself an abomination

"you haven't been up here much have you? Well as far as I know, everyone here thinks that being a male omega is a joke from god, something worse that dirt, so being one you can guess why I think were joking when you said you wanted me to be your mate, so, tell me what that entitles me exactly"- dean asked, a little curious has what the demon had to say

"well, when a human decides to mate a demon he or she has to be turned into one first , and in order for you to become a demon you'll need my blood, mating mark and knot, then it will take a few hours for your transition from human to demon to be completed, when you wake up the next day has a demon you'll already know how to control everything from your tail to your eyes, it gets engraved in your memory forever, but in order to properly mate both of us have to bare ach other mark, in demon culture, everyone is treated equally no matter how they presented, so you and I are equals after mating and becoming the queen of hell you can do what you want, if you want you can work in what you want being bit torture someone or simply making deals, so dean, will you become a demon and my mate?" - cas said with a little smile

 

"yes, I will, just three questions thou, will I need to pack anything and, when will we mate and how will I know you kept your part of the deal and saved my mother?"

"no, you wont need to pack anything, everything you need has already been taken cared for you, I'll show you our room later, first I'll give you a tour thru hell and I want to have dinner with you to get to know each other better before we mate, and if you want to know if my part of the deal has been kept you can go see your mother, I told you, you can do what you want"- cas said approaching dean until he was just a few inches away from him

"can we go see her now?"

"first we need to seal the deal"-cas whispered in his ear

"how? Do we shake hands or?-dean asked

"we seal it with a kiss"

"a kiss huh? What's stopping y"-dean was suddenly interrupted by cas' lips on his sealing his deal, the kiss was chaste at first and when cas' hands grabbed his hips pulling him even closer to the demon earning a gasp from dean, he used the opportunity to push his tongue inside the omega claiming his mouth, after a few minutes like this cas ended the kiss earning a whimper from dean

"we can go see her now, by the way, I decided to sweeten the deal a little, not only did I saved her, she'll only die of old age, no more sickness and no accidents, she'll live a full life"

"why? You only needed to cure her, what changed your
