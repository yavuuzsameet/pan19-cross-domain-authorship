Whatever.

“Dean,” Sam called over his shoulder, as he led their way towards the library.

When he couldn’t hear the steady shuffle of his brother’s footsteps behind him, he paused, turning to find Dean single-mindedly following the pigeons that had clustered on the sidewalk outside of the building. Sam expected a flurry of wings when Dean ambled into the midst of the flock, but his pace was so sedate that the pigeons remained teasingly just out of reach. The birds were able to keep on with their crumb-pecking meandering as Dean wandered aimlessly amongst them, following whatever bit of movement caught his eye.

But then Dean refocused his attentions on the only non-moving target in the area, an elderly woman who sat at the bus bench eating a donut and sipping some coffee, her back to the scene. Dean shuffled silently closer, the drag of his shoes on the sidewalk whisper soft, and a tiny bit of drool collected in the corner of his mouth like a teardrop just waiting to fall.

Sam jogged back to grab Dean by the arm when it was only inches away from the woman’s shoulder, and dragged him away. Dean groaned at Sam in response, and Sam just smiled, guiding Dean towards a nearby kiosk.

“Stop grumbling. I know we skipped breakfast. How does a cinnamon pretzel sound? My treat!”

Sam discovered early on that, much like a teething baby, Dean had developed a habit of chewing on whatever he could reach. More than a few Motorhead tapes had been lost to the cause on their drives, though Dean spat out the Neil Diamond that had somehow hidden itself in the back of the glovebox. Everything Sam had found at the pet store that might curb this instinct did not actually fit Dean’s head due to his lack of a pronounced snout, which left his jaw all too able to bite that hand that fed him. This resulted in Sam with fingers covered in bandages and dependent on the only alternative he could think of, which was an S&M; store he found in the yellow pages that offered a wide variety of leather restraints, according to their ad.

The knowing grin the salesclerk gave him as he stuffed the muzzle and the thick leather collar and chain into the nondescript paper bag made Sam hustle out of there with Dean as quickly as possible, leaving their new shadow Castiel behind, curiously studying an assortment of what Sam wouldn’t dare guess the purpose of.

Castiel didn’t seem to see a problem with the current situation. He said something about God’s plan and Lucifer while Sam only half-listened, too busy trying to figure out how the straps worked and worrying if Dean’s bite was contagious, like those movies about zombie monkeys in England. Once he figured he wasn’t going to turn into the walking undead – and that the straps went over, under, and then through – Sam had snarkily suggested that maybe if Dean ate Lucifer, that might fix the problem for everyone.

The angel had paused, giving him that head-tilt-stare combo, and quietly agreed that it might work, but he needed to check with his superiors before instigating any further plan of action in that vein. He then disappeared in a quiet ruffle of feathers, and Sam dropped his face into his hands as Dean gnawed on the bedpost.

Hunting progressed at its usual pace. Sam was surprised at the sheer number of supernatural creatures that eating seemed to vanquish; it sure was saving them a lot on silver bullets and rock salt. Dean might not be so steady with a weapon any longer, but he had the patience of the dead, and an eerily empty determination to catch whatever it was that was running away from him. Dean’s shuffling gait never ceased until he’d caught what he was after.

Sam supposed that made Dean a little like a greyhound running after a rabbit - a slow, zombie greyhound, hunting eight-foot rabbits that had very sharp teeth and claws.

He became a little concerned that his brother might develop a bit of a gut, since Dean spent most of his time eating someone or other, most of whom were a lot bigger than he was. Being dead, or even not-so-dead, hadn’t done a thing to curb his brother’s appetite. But Dean must have come back from the dead with two hollow legs, because while he might appear pregnant for several hours after a successful hunt – or if he managed to wander away from Sam for any length of time - the roundness of his belly always dissipated as the day wore on.

Sam named Dean’s occasional food-baby anyway, just because it seemed to annoy his brother when Sam patted his stomach and asked when he was due.

Its name was Lester.

What perhaps annoyed Sam the most was that even though Dean was one of the undead, Dean still had better luck with women than Sam did.

Sam thought that was just downright unfair. Dean smelled funny, only about one out of every twenty words was intelligible, and he lacked a functioning pulse, but women still seemed
