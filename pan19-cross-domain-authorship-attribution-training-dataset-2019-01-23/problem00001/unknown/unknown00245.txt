it was money issues..." Benny knew about the car crash his parents were in. He didn't know the other part to it.

"And?"

Dean glanced up to Benny. He was taken back by the anguish in Deans eyes, "What's going on Dean?"

~~~~~~~~~~~

After Dean had left, the door slamming behind him, Cas had promptly thrown things around, breaking whatever there was in his vicinity.

He huffed as he looked around the broken glass and canvases around him. 

Cas grabbed his coat and went to the nearest bar.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dean had told Benny everything, well everything that Cas had already knew.

Benny looked at him sadly. He pulled Dean into a hug, "It's not you're fault, Cas didn't mean that. You need to know that, he's just angry at himself."

Dean nodded.

"All Alphas like to provide for their families, it makes them feel like their doing something right."

Dean nodded again and separated from Benny, "Thanks."

Benny clapped his shoulder, "Things will be okay."

Dean gave him a real smile, his hand going to his stomach to where he could feel light fluttering.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cas had a few drinks in him already. He noticed an Omega wouldn't stop looking at him. Cas could feel her gaze on him.

She had ended up coming up to him and sitting down next to him.

"Hey handsome, want to get out of here?"

Cas put his drink up to his lips, taking a sip, "No. I already got a mate." Cas presented his mate mark from Dean.

The girl curled into Cas, making her body touch him wherever she could. She leaned up to whisper in his ear.

"C'mon. They don't need to know." Cas had to admit she was pretty but she wasn't Dean, he didn't want a random Omega.

She moved to put her lips to Cas's neck, right over Deans mark. She bit down lightly and Cas jerked back, hands moving to push her away.

"No, I'm not going to go with you. I don't want to do anything with you, I want my mate only."

The girl huffed, "Fine. Your loss buddy." She stomped off, leaving Cas.

Cas sighed and looked at the time, it was time to pick Sam up from school.

Cas gathered his things and paid his bill and left.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Sam had ran to Cas when his class was released. He almost knocked Cas over since he was a little buzzed.

"Hey buddy. Have a good day?" Cas started walking towards his car, holding Sams hand.

Sam looked up to Cas, confusion on his face, "Cassie? Are you ok? You sick?"

Cas shook his head, stopping right after when he got a little dizzy, "M'fine."

Sam shrugged and got in the car, trusting Cas.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Dean got home from work, the house was a mess and it was quiet. He heard Sam come running  down stairs.

"Dean!"

Dean bent down and hugged Sam.

"How are you Sammy?"

"M'ungry."

Dean furrowed his eyebrows, "Didn't you eat dinner a couple hours ago?"

Sam shook his head no, "I didn't eat dinner!"

Dean was more confused, "Cas didn't feed you dinner?"

"No... Cas has been upset all day, he had this bottle with the liquid I'm not allowed to drink with him all day. When he came to pick me up I thought he was sick, he was all dizzy and smelled bad."

Dean frowned, "Okay... Let's get you something to eat then I'll go check on Cas while you eat. Okay?"

Sam nodded but then he turned to look at Dean, "I didn't get Cassie in trouble did I? I didn't want too! He's so sad De."

Dean kissed his forehead, "If Cas is in any kind of trouble it's because he put himself in that situation."

Dean grabbed Sams hand and led him to the kitchen, making Sam something quick to eat for dinner.

"Where is Cas Sam?"

Sam stopped eating and looked at Dean, "In your guys' room. Last time I checked he was crying and drinking out of one of the bottles. I tried to see what was wrong but he yelled at me to go away."

Dean nodded and proceeded to their room, the door was open and he could see Cas, staring at a wall on the floor.

"You picked Sam up drunk."

Cas slowly turned his head to face Dean, "And?"

Dean walked in and closed the door, "Do you know how dangerous that is? You could have gotten you both killed!"

"I didn't though. I s-was in control." Cas was slurring his words bad.

Dean laughed, "Well you're not now. Lets get you on the bed."

Dean bent down
