, please, don't go away, don't, please,"Viktor begged as he held Yuuri who just shot himself in the stomache, who's currently bleeding very hard, Yuuri's brown eyes stared at Viktor's teary ones as Yuuri was reaching the end of his life, Yuuri thought that it would be more painful to shoot himself in the stomache, so he can have the pain he deserves before he leaves the world

 

"Yuuri, I-i'm afraid of l-losing you, please, don't go away, Yuuri, why did you do this? i could help you get through this, i'll be all alone again, don't just leave like my parents and leave me suffering in this stupid world, don't,"Viktor cried as he stroked back the black locks that belongs to his lover, his Yuuri,

 "I-i'm sorry, Viktor, please, be happy after i'm gone, okay? i-i love you, я тебя люблю (ya tebya lyublyu),Vitya, 愛してるよ (aishiteru yo), Viktor, i love you so much,so i want you to be happy, okay?"Yuuri said, smiling a little,

More tears spilled out of Viktor's eyes, he pressed his lips on Yuuri's for a few seconds, wishing for it to be longer, wishing they had all the time in the world, but if he makes it longer, Yuuri will already be gone,

"I- i love you too, Yuuri," Viktor said, Yuuri smiled once more,

"Thank you, Vitya, i love you, Vitya," and with that,

 


 Yuuri closed his eyes slowly, and left the world forever, 


 


 Leaving Viktor all alone, once more, 


 

Le tue mani, le tue gambe, le mie mani, le mie gambe, e i battiti del cuore si fondono tra loro

 Your hands, your legs,  My hands, my legs,   And our heartbeats  Are blending together 

Viktor stared at the grave as they put Yuuri down inside it, he couldn't help but to remember all the moments he had together, right from the beginning, the stadium they were in during the Grand Prix Final 2015, Yuuri left as Viktor had asked if he wanted to take a picture with him,

 


He remembers when he surprises Yuuri butt naked in the onsen in his home, 



He remembers when they practiced together,



He remembers those special moments between them in Yuuri's home,



He remembers when he made Yuuri cry in the cup of china



He remembers when they had their first kiss in front of the whole crowd, in an international tv,



He remembers when they exchanged rings in Barcelona, the grand prix final,



He remembers when they moved in together,



He remembers when they had their special night,



He remembers when they got married, and eventually having another special night afterwards,



He remembers those moments when they're all alone in the house,



Viktor remembers all the moments he had with Yuuri


 

And of course, the pair skate they had together, the way their hands, their legs, gracefully moved in sync on the ice as thousands of people watched them skate together, the way their heartbeats, are blending together, the way Yuuri's hands would brush across Viktor's chin, the faces of thousands of people stunned as they watched them skate,Viktor remembers every single little detail during their first pair skate,

 


But now, Viktor has to let all the memories go,


 

 

Partiamo insieme Let’s leave together

 


"Yuuri, let's leave this world together,"Viktor said, as they laid down on their bed, Viktor's finger twirling around their wedding ring,



"Commit a double suicide? that's what Dazai Osamu from bungou stray dogs wants,"Yuuri said, making a reference to an anime he watched,



"However it could be, i want to leave this world together, with you, and before it, i want to spend the rest of my life with you, Yuuri,"Viktor said,



"Cheesy," Yuuri scoffed,



"I know right?, it's like those cheesy romantic fanfictions," Viktor said, grinning,



"But why did you suddenly said 'let's leave this world together?' " Yuuri asked,



Viktor laughed a nervous laugh, and spoke, 


 


"maybe because i don't want to be alone if you're gone before me,"


 

A month has passed like a blink of an eye, the world was shocked at the news of the popular Japanese figure skater, Katsuki Yuuri's death, suicide, to be precise, a lot of people were sad at his loss, but even if those sadness of each people combined to one, it'll barely reach Viktor's,

Yurio, Otabek, and Phichit constantly visited Viktor to check if he's okay, usually they'd cook something for him, take care of him, and last week, Yuuri's family visited him once again, last time they did was two months ago, since the funeral is held on Japan,

Yuuri's family were worried, but of
