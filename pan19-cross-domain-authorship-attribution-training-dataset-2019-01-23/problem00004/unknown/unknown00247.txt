some... Fun, Viktor replied, looking at Mila, winking at Sara. Look at her, without this redhead we would die because of the blonde savage, the stoic man, or because of me... Impossible.

- You are a real fucker, you know that, Viktor, Georgi asked with a sight. Seriously we needed some, he stopped himself, looking at Mila's back, nevermind.

Deinitely not my day, I swear.

- Okay then, Otabek was trying hard to not look at Yuri, but he had a million questions for him, he wanted to know everything from his favorite colour -which he knew was pastel pink- to his shoe size. Where did you started playing, I mean, he stopped himself for a while, we all know the story about the garage and all that stuff but... When and how, his question wasn't as clear as it seemed on his paper « Ask Yuri on how he joined the band of older russians ».

- Good one, nobody asked me how I ended with all those seniors : finally a good question ma, Yuri looked at him with malicious eyes. They don't want to admit it, but they begged me to join the band.

- Yeah, you threatened Mila saying that you would kill here reputation on Instagram if we would not let you in, Georgi interrupted, while Mila was pouring herself a glass of water that Viktor brought on the table.

- … She had to be careful about what she did for God's sake, I'm not her mother, plus you needed a guitarist, he looked at Otabek sighing with despair, the were really sucking at the bar where I saw them...

- The real question is : what were you doing in a bar at fourteen, Vikor asked, curling his hair around his finger, smiling at him.

Otabek couldn't follow the stream of consciousness, they were nearly forgetting that Sara was taking some photographs and Otabek recording all. Yuri ended up swelling his cheeks, reddish, crossing his arms, like a child pouting. Otabek found him more sweet, and looking at him shaking his golden head while Georgi was laughing, Viktor joking and Mila getting little by little sober ; he was looking like an angel in disguise surrounded by mortals, a halo around his blonde head

- You wanna my number too, boy, Yuri asked, looking at him half smiling.

And that was the moment Otabek knew, he had to take this chance.

 

Okay, since I'm into it I'm productive and I know where I'm going -more or less haha-I hope you enjoy reading it, because I enjoy writing it (because I had an awful blank page syndrom for a few months but now it seems like being fine haha)Thanks for reading! ♥

(And sorry for my english, I'm trying to improve myself as much as I can haha)

… But he failed. He just smiled back, facing him trying to not show him how much he was impressed by him, how much he wanted to touch his shiny hair, how much he wanted to touch his lips with his, how much he wanted to kiss him, he shook his head, rolled his eyes as if he was just annoyed by this question -smartass Altin, really, he will think you think he's a little child-.

- I was just lost in my thoughts, I'm sorry, he replied, looking him right in the eye, the blonde only raised his eyebrow, puffing a bit and looked at Mila.

- Whatever, I think she will have her number anyway, he murmured, winding a lock of hair around his index, then he took his smartphone, as casually as always.

- Last question, Otabek dared to ask while Sara was trying to take some photographs of this encounter ; but not least : do you watch any youtubers, and if you do, which ?

This question was dedicated to Yuri before all, Otabek was curious about what he listened to, he dreamt about a Yuri listening to classical music, earphones on his golden hair, raising his perfect hand to the sky, smiling -with this beautiful smile he managed to imagine-, enjoying each moment, each sound, devouring them, loving them, adoring them.

- I'm not into youtubers, answered Viktor, a glass of water in hand, legs crossed, a precious aura around him. None of us is... Maybe this little one is more or less fond of some, he said showing with his chin the younger member of the group who rose his head, sighing loudly.

- Yeah, I'm the more « modern » of us, not a big surprise for oldies like you, he said, a smirk drawn on his face, a childish face trying to throw them off balance : but he failed. Hem. Yeah, I'm following some youtubers more or less, but nothing basic like video games or all that stuff, I'm really not into it, he said fingers under his jaw like in a painting, like precious women in a literary salon
