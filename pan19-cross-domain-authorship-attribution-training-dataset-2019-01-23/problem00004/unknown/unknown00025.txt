, not making any sense. But I don't fucking care, at all."

 

I woke up to my phone ringing non-stop. "UGH!!! FUCKING SHIT STOP THAT!!!" I yelled. I reached over on my nightstand and looked at see who was calling me. 


Yuuri Katsuki


My eyes widen at the caller ID, I quickly answered it feeling more awake. "Yuuri?" I said a little confused. Didn't he go to a party or something?

"YURIO!" Yuuri's voice shouted through the phone. 

I pulled away glaring at the phone, "Fucking bitch." I muttered. "What the hell do you want this late?" I said feeling angry.

"VIKTOR WANTS TO GO SOMEWHERE PRIVATE!!! SHOULD I GO WITH HIM? WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS?" Yuuri continued to yell through the phone.

"Put Viktor on the phone." I told yuuri. There was a shuffle of sound before a different voice spoke through the phone.

"Hello?" 

"Viktor! What the hell are you planning?" I growled at him.

"Wow! I didn't know that you cared about this." Viktor gasped into the phone. 

"Are you drunk?" I asked. 

"Just a little tispy." He answered.

"Put Yuuri back on the phone." I demanded.

There was more shuffling before Yuuri's voice came back on. "Yurio?" He sounded calm now.

"Listen don't go anywhere with Viktor okay? I'm going to come and pick you up. Can you go outside?" I carefully asked.

"Yeah! What are we doing? Can we get some food?" Yuuri asked cheerfuly.

I smiled at the phone, he's so cute. "Yeah sure. Make sure you wait outside okay?"

"Yeah!"

I hanged up and rubbed my eye with my hands. I slowly got out of bed and got on my shoes before leaving the small apartment. 



"'Cause I have hella feelings for you. I act like I don't fucking care. Like they ain't even there."

 

I held onto Yuuri as I carefully sat him in the car. "Bye Yuuri! I'll miss you!" Yuuri practically screamed. I growled as I closed the car door. Buzzed my ass, I thought as Viktor tripped over his own feet walking back into the house.

I sighed and ran my fingers through my hair. This is going to be a pain in the ass.

Driving to Yuuri's place I kept a tight grip on the steering wheel, as Yuuri kept yelling.

"Biktor! Biktor! Yurio where's Biktor?" Yuuri asked leaning towards me. 

"It's pronounced, Viktor pig." I scowled turning into Yuuri's driveway.

"Biktor is so nice." Yuuri sighed. 

"I'm sure he is." I mutter getting out of the car. I helped Yuuri get out and unlocked his front door. 

"C'mon be quiet, don't wake up your family." I hissed as Yuuri nearly knocked over a glass plate. 

"Sssssorrryyy!" Yuuri loudly whispered. 

I groaned and closed Yuuri's bedroom behind me. Yuuri flopped down on his bed and laid down. 

"Night, Yurio." He mumbled sleepily.

I softly smiled at him, that's cute. I covered Yuuri up with a blanket before putting a kiss on his forehead. 

"Goodnight Yuuri, sweet dreams." 



"'Cause I have hella feelings for you. I act like I don't fucking care, 'cause I'm so fucking scared."

 

I quietly watched as Viktor and Yuuri started skating together. They looked like they belonged together, on ice off of ice. The perfect duo. I glared as Viktor waved at me, I quickly looked away and started working on my program. 

"Yura! Take a break!" The coach yelled. I nodded my head and skated off of the rink. Before I opened the locker door I heard laughter. I carefully pressed my ear against the door and listened in.

"I've been thinking Yuuri." Viktor's voice said. 

I gulped and held my breath, I got a good feeling of what's about to happpen.

"Would you like to go out on a date with me?" Viktor asked. 

"I-is this a joke?" Yuuri's voice squeaked out. I can only imagine what Yuuri's face is like right now.

"No, why? A-are you crying? Yuuri what's wrong?" Viktor inquired.

"I don't want to be another one night stand with you." Yuuri hiccup.

"No, no, moya. I want to be with you, give this a chance, yes? I'll do my best to make you happy." Viktor said soothingly.

"Really?" Yuuri whispered.

"Yes, I do. Will you?" 

"How can I say no?"

I closed my eyes as I felt my heart drop in my chest. It clenched tightly as I felt my eyes burn from the tears forming. 






I'm so fucking stupid.
